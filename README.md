🎓 Second Year Engineering Student | 🤖 AI Enthusiast | 💻 Full-Stack Developer

🧠 About Me
I'm currently pursuing my engineering degree and exploring the intersection of AI, computer vision, and real-world health solutions. My most recent project focuses on using artificial intelligence to address a critical and often-overlooked issue: poor posture. With guidance from industry and faculty mentors, I developed a system that detects posture in real time, offers instant feedback, and promotes better ergonomics.

💼 Featured Project: Posture Recognition Software Using AI
🔍 Overview
An intelligent software solution built to analyze human posture in real-time using computer vision and AI, designed to reduce musculoskeletal disorders and improve user productivity and health.

🚩 Problem
Poor posture leads to chronic back pain, fatigue, and productivity loss. Existing solutions lack real-time feedback, personalization, and practicality.

🎯 Objectives
Detect and classify posture using pose estimation (OpenPose / MediaPipe)

Offer instant feedback and posture improvement suggestions

Track progress over time with personalized analytics

Ensure cross-platform compatibility (web/mobile)

🛠️ Tech Stack
AI/ML: TensorFlow, PyTorch

Computer Vision: MediaPipe, OpenPose

Frontend: Flutter, React Native

Backend: Node.js

Database: Firebase, SQLite

Tools: Git, Figma, Gantt charts for planning

📈 Impact
Real-time posture alerts → Better health awareness

Workplace adoption → Fewer injuries, improved productivity

Future-ready platform → Expansion into healthcare and ergonomics research

📌 Future Goals
I'm looking to expand this project with wearable tech integration, personalized ergonomics plans, and advanced analytics using machine learning.
